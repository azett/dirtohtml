Great thing about Open Source software is: Everyone can participate!

Meet the people helping me with DirToHTML:
- Hüsi [asked for many functions](https://www.fachinformatiker.de/topic/98722-verzeichnisinhalt-auflisten-tool-gesucht/) and tested the heck out of the early versions.
- Props to MB for the JavaScript that expands the folders.
- [Janek](http://www.janek.org/) helped with his FileComparator class. Thanks!
- Of course, thanks to [Jörg Vonderheide](https://www.vdheide.de/) for his MP§ framework.
- Pascal König fixed the charsets in the HTML files (version 0.6.6) - thx!
- The BrowserControl class was published by Mark Weakly at [javaworld.com](http://www.javaworld.com/).
